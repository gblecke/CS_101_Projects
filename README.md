# CS_101_Projects
This is a collection of projects I designed during my time taking the UA course geared towards teaching C++.

Each project was geared towards specific fundamentals of the course. For example, Project 1 is omitted because it was a "Hello World!" based project that walked through setting up the text editor to be used for the course. Project 2 tasked us with reading information from text files and sorting the list of ints or strings. The guidelints gave us a hard cap that would be tested. This reduced the need to create a dynamic array or worry about an overload.
Project 3 had students practicing management of pointers in a linked list. The linked list was used to manage a queue to show we could edit the list without causing memory issues with the pointers. Project 4 had us design a hash table that would sort, search, and return pertinent information for the operation of the hash table. Project 5 had students design a huffman tree based on an array of numbers provided in a file. Given both an inorder and preorder traversal, the tree would be constructed one node at a time.
