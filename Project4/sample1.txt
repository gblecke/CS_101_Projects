Cryptography is both the practice and study of the techniques used
to communicate and/or store information or data privately and
securely, without being intercepted by third parties. This can include
processes such as encryption, hashing, and steganography. Until the
modern era, cryptography almost exclusively referred to encryption, but
now cryptography is a broad field with applications in many critical
areas of our lives.
